# Semantic Search API

### Build a Zero-Cost Semantic Search Engine with Cloudflare Workers

This project provides a production-ready semantic search engine built entirely on Cloudflare's free-tier infrastructure.

The API follows OpenAPI specifications with full Swagger documentation available at `/swagger.json`, making it easy to integrate and use in your applications.

## Installation

### Option 1: One-Click Deploy
[![Deploy to Cloudflare Workers](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/SemanticSearch-ai/api.semanticsearch.ai.git)

Before deployment, create a Vectorize index as described in step 4 below.

### Option 2: Manual Setup
1. Sign up for [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.dev). The free tier is more than enough for most use cases.
2. Clone this project and install dependencies with `pnpm install`
3. Run `wrangler login` to login to your Cloudflare account in wrangler
4. Create a Vectorize index for semantic search:
   ```bash
   wrangler vectorize create semantic-search --dimensions=384 --metric=cosine
   ```
5. Run `wrangler deploy` to publish the API to Cloudflare Workers

Once deployed, set the API key by updating the `API_KEY` environment variable.

## Usage

The API provides the following endpoints for managing and searching documents:

### Create/Update a document
```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-worker.workers.dev/v1/documents" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "text": "This is a sample document for semantic search",
    "id": "document-id",
    "metadata": {
      "source": "example",
      "category": "documentation"
    }
  }'
```

Response:
```json
{
  "id": "document-id"
}
```

### Retrieve a document
```bash
curl -X GET "https://your-worker.workers.dev/v1/documents/{document-id}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Response:
```json
{
  "id": "document-id",
  "text": "This is a sample document for semantic search",
  "metadata": {
    "source": "example",
    "category": "documentation"
  }
}
```

### Delete a document
```bash
curl -X DELETE "https://your-worker.workers.dev/v1/documents/{document-id}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Response:
```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

### Search documents
```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-worker.workers.dev/v1/search" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "query": "sample document",
    "limit": 10
  }'
```

Response:
```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "document-id",
      "text": "This is a sample document for semantic search",
      "metadata": {
        "source": "example",
        "category": "documentation"
      },
      "score": 0.95
    }
  ]
}
```

All endpoints require authentication using a Bearer token in the Authorization header. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key.

## Development

1. Run `wrangler dev` to start a local instance of the API.
2. Open `http://localhost:8787/` in your browser to see the Swagger interface where you can try the endpoints.
3. Changes made in the `src/` folder will automatically trigger the server to reload, you only need to refresh the Swagger interface.
